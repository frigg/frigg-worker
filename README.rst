The worker has two modes `builder` and `deployer` which defines whether the worker should
build and run tests or deploy previews.

Builder
~~~~~~~
Runs tasks within a given docker container before removing the docker container and reports
to the build report API of HQ.

Deployer
~~~~~~~~
Starts a docker container that will run for the amount of time specified by the task payload
before running deploy tasks inside the container. The container exposes port 8000 to a port
on the host system given by the task payload. The container-image is chosen from the task
payload, thus, the worker trusts the task-queue to only contain tasks with allowed images.
The status of the deployments is reported to the preview-deployment API of HQ.
